# Space Invaders (2D)

> Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up arcade game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado. Space Invaders was the first fixed shooter and set the template for the shoot 'em up genre.

Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. While the player has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.
